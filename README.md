# EnglishMarbleSolitaire
The goal of this project is to create a JavaFX-based graphical user interface (GUI) for an English marble solitaire game.  English marble solitaire is a single player board game that is typically played on a board with thirty-three holes. The game is set up so that a marble is placed in all the holes except for the center hole. 
The objective is to have the lowest score by collect as many of the marbles from the board as possible. The game is designed to end and tally the score when the player wins the game (i.e., there is just one marble left on the board) or the player cannot make any more legal moves, or the player voluntarily quits.
